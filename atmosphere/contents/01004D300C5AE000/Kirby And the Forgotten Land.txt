Note;

When using 60 FPS, Game Speed will slow down whenever FPS Drops.

Resolution Hacks will not work straight away after activating it. You need to move around a little to change effect. And unfortunately it only works in Handheld Mode because it's not working properly in Docked Mode.

Thanks to @lucky for providing a guide to find the FPS Code.
