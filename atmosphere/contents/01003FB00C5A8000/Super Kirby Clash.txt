ips patch for lower res located at: https://gbatemp.net/threads/super-kirby-clash-60fps-hack.552827/

Hack for Super Kirby Clash that makes the game run at 60 FPS at all time rather than only in menus. It is hitting that target framerate 99% of the time in handheld mode when using the below OC, a lower OC could also be stable but when a lot of effects are onscreen it might drop to 30FPS. Only tested in handheld mode and will probably be unstable in docked mode unless you use ReverseNX.

handheld_charging_cpu=1785
handheld_charging_gpu=768
handheld_charging_mem=1600

To install it simply copy the 01003FB00C5A8000 folder to the contents folder in the atmosphere folder, since this is a cheat you will need Edizon to enable it.

Note: The 60FPS+LowerRes mod makes the game run at 60FPS as well as dropping resolution to 480p in handheld mode and 720p for docked mode, and as a result it doesnt need a lot of OC:

handheld_cpu=1785
handheld_charging_gpu=537
handheld_gpu=460
handheld_mem=1600
docked_cpu=1785
docked_gpu=921
