Note;

AA High, AA Very High and AA Max are removed because it crashes the game. AA is really unstable so don't switch/change AA too much. Just pick the one you want and leave it as it is to avoid crash.

=====
[Upscale Quality] Is also known as Graphics Texture Filtering and it's noticeable (more usable) when using lower RRS + AA OFF, + AA Very Low or + AA Low.

Type-0: Nearest filtering

Type-1: Simple Bilinear

Type-2: Directional blur with unsharp mask upsample. (default)

Type-3: 5-tap Catmull-Rom bicubic, approximating Lanczos 2.

Type-4: 13-tap Lanczos 3.

Type-5: 36-tap Gaussian-filtered unsharp mask (very expensive, but good for extreme upsampling)

=====

[RRS] is Render Resolution Scale and it disables Dynamic Resolution Function.
Please use;
Handheld RRS for Handheld Mode.
Docked RRS for Docked Mode.
Don't activate them at the same time!

[SSR] Is Screen Space Reflection.

[SSS] Is Screenspace Subsurface Scattering.

Some GFX Codes has no Function/Effect to the Game.
