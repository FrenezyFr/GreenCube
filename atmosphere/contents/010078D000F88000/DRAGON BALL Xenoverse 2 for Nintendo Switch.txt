[FPS Toggle] Button Combos;

Press R Stick + Left Dpad = 30 FPS
Press R Stick + Right Dpad = 60 FPS


FPS Cheats only works in Battles because 60 FPS is not a good experience during exploration mode (Handheld Mode + Max OC).

Also when using 60 FPS, Game Speed will slow down when FPS drops.
