1.) [RRS] is Render Resolution Scale and it disables Dynamic Resolution Function.
Please use;
Handheld RRS for Handheld Mode.
Docked RRS for Docked Mode.
Don't activate them at the same time!


2.) Game will crash if the following are both activated;

[Use TAAU] + [AA High (Default TAA)]
or
[Use TAAU] + [AA Very High]
or
[Use TAAU] + [AA Max]

3.) [Don't Use TAAU & FSR], [Use TAAU (FSR OFF)] & [Use FSR (TAAU OFF)] will override the in-game FSR option.

4.) [Fully Load Textures ASAP] not included because it freezes the game.
