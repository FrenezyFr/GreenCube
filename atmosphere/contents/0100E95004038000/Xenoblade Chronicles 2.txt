60 FPS known issues;

1.) Game Speed will slow down whenever FPS Drops.

2.) Might not work properly if you have a Patch/Mod installed.

The Cutscenes Speed Fix drops the FPS to 30 to fix the Game from Speeding up whenever Cutscenes occur.

Notes; 

1.) [RRS] is Render Resolution Scale and it disables Dynamic Resolution Function.
Please use;
Handheld RRS for Handheld Mode.
Docked RRS for Docked Mode.

2.) [RRS] may not work or may not be accurate if there's a Mod/Patch used such as Resolution/Graphics Mod etc.

3.) Going above 720p Crashes the game.
