=====

[RRS] is Render Resolution Scale. For some reason, Dynamic Resolution Function & Min/Max Screen Percentage doesn't exist in the memory. So we can only reach 100% 720p. But RRS should persists the resolution as long as the cheat is active.

Some GFX Codes has no Function/Effect to the Game.
