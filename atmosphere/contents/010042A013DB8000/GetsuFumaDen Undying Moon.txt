=====

[RRS] is Render Resolution Scale and it disables Dynamic Resolution Function.
Please use;
Handheld RRS for Handheld Mode.
Docked RRS for Docked Mode.

Some GFX Codes has no Function/Effect to the Game.

I also removed;

[AA High (Default TAA)]
[AA Very High]
[AA Max]

Because the Game will crash if one of those is used.
