=====

[Upscale Quality] Is noticeable (more usable) when using lower RRS + AA OFF, AA Very Low or AA Low.

Type-0: Nearest filtering

Type-1: Simple Bilinear

Type-2: Directional blur with unsharp mask upsample.

Type-3: 5-tap Catmull-Rom bicubic, approximating Lanczos 2. (default)

Type-4: 13-tap Lanczos 3.

Type-5: 36-tap Gaussian-filtered unsharp mask (very expensive, but good for extreme upsampling)


[RRS] is Render Resolution Scale and it disables Dynamic Resolution Function. Also some RRS may not fit the display to the screen correctly.
Please use;
Handheld RRS for Handheld Mode.
Docked RRS for Docked Mode.
And please don't activate both at the same time!

Some GFX Codes has no Function/Effect to the Game.
