[RRS] is Render Resolution Scale and it disables Dynamic Resolution Function.
Please use:
Handheld RRS for Handheld Mode.

Don't activate them at the same time!

Some GFX Codes has no Function/Effect to the Game.
For stable FPS you can use MIN GFX Quality with [Bloom] low. With this options you can play 480p@60FPS. But better try yourselfs to find good condition.
Need close to MAX OC, depend of you options.
