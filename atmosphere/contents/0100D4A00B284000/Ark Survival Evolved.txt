=====
[Upscale Quality] Is noticeable (more usable) when using lower RRS + AA OFF, AA Very Low or AA Low.

Type-0: Nearest filtering
Type-1: Simple Bilinear
Type-2: Directional blur with unsharp mask upsample. (default)
Type-3: 5-tap Catmull-Rom bicubic, approximating Lanczos 2.
Type-4: 13-tap Lanczos 3.
Type-5: 36-tap Gaussian-filtered unsharp mask (very expensive, but good for extreme upsampling)

[RRS] is Render Resolution Scale and it disables Dynamic Resolution Function.
Please use:
Handheld RRS for Handheld Mode.
Docked RRS for Docked Mode.
Don't activate them at the same time!

Some GFX Codes has no Function/Effect to the Game.
Need OC
