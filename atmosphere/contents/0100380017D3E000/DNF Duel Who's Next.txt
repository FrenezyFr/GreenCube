Game is already capped at 60 FPS.
Capping it to 30 FPS just slows down the game speed.

Notes;

1.) By default, The game's DR Operator is not r.DynamicRes.OperationMode (0x087F95E0).
It's r.EnableDynamicResolution (0x07B19450) and it ignores r.DynamicRes.MaxScreenPercentage (0x087D69C8). That's why we have to enable r.DynamicRes.OperationMode (0x087F95E0). too.

2.) Reverse NX RT will not work properly if r.EnableDynamicResolution (0x07B19450) is OFF. That's why I have to add it to RRS turned ON.

[RRS] is Render Resolution Scale.
Please use;
Handheld RRS for Handheld Mode.
Docked RRS for Docked Mode.
Don't activate them at the same time!
