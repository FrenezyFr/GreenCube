60 FPS known Issues;

1.) 2D Elements and some Effects seems to run faster.

2.) FPS will drop straight to 30 if Switch can't handle 60 FPS.

Notes; 

1.) [RRS] is Render Resolution Scale and it disables Dynamic Resolution Function.
Please use;
Handheld RRS for Handheld Mode.
Docked RRS for Docked Mode.

2.) [RRS] may not work or may not be accurate if there's a Mod/Patch used such as Resolution/Graphics Mod etc.

3.) Going above 720p Crashes the game.
