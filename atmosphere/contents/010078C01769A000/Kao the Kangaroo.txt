Note:
[Upscale Quality] Is also known as Graphics Texture Filtering and it's noticeable (more usable) when using lower RRS + AA OFF, AA Very Low or AA Low.
Type-0: Nearest filtering
Type-1: Simple Bilinear
Type-2: Directional blur with unsharp mask upsample. (default)
Type-3: 5-tap Catmull-Rom bicubic, approximating Lanczos 2.
Type-4: 13-tap Lanczos 3.
Type-5: 36-tap Gaussian-filtered unsharp mask (very expensive, but good for extreme upsampling)
