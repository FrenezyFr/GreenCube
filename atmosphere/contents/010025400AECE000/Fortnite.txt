60 FPS isn't stable even with full OC (at max as HOS allows, haven't tried with KazushiMe OC mods), playing in dock mode with this cheat is painful sometimes, you can get the best experience playing on handheld mode with full OC, OR playing on TV setting the console profile to handheld with Masagrator's plugin ReverseNX (needs SaltyNX)
