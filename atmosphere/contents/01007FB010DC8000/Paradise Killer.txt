=====
[Upscale Quality] Is noticeable (more usable) when using lower RRS.

Type-0: Nearest filtering

Type-1: Simple Bilinear

Type-2: Directional blur with unsharp mask upsample. (Default)

Type-3: 5-tap Catmull-Rom bicubic, approximating Lanczos 2.

Type-4: 13-tap Lanczos 3.

Type-5: 36-tap Gaussian-filtered unsharp mask (very expensive, but good for extreme upsampling)

[RRS] is Render Resolution Scale and it disables Dynamic Resolution Function.
Please use:
Handheld RRS for Handheld Mode.
Docked RRS for Docked Mode.
Don't activate them at the same time!

No [AA] code, because its crash game.
Some GFX Codes has no Function/Effect to the Game.
Need so close to MAX OC, depend of yours options.
