How to use;

1.) RRS Cheats are for Docked Mode only and effects are not applied on the fly. So all you have to do is Undock => Dock for the cheats to apply. Or use ⁠reverse-nx-rt  Mode: Handheld => Mode: Docked which is much easier to do.

2.) You can experience these in Handheld . Just use ⁠reverse-nx-rt and set mode to Mode: Docked.

Notes;

1.) The RRS 1440p and 4K 2160p are experimental for use with Emulator. It may crash the game if you use it on Switch Console.
